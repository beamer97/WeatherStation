# WeatherStation
Personal dashboard to collect and display local weather and home environment data from a variety of sensors

Use personal local database on NAS to store many differnet points

Currently using first prototype of my pocket environemt scanner to capture internal home data (Arduino Nano)
Want to make a smaller version that would use the OLED screen

Create a version to run on the Raspberry Pi
Would just be the Temp/Humidity sensor through the GPIO pins (maybe make something work with the tiny OLED screen)
This would act as the 'Home Base' and serve to update the Home table of the DB

Need to create executable for running the serial and database communications communications [C over current Python implementation]

Need a dashboard screen to be able to display data
